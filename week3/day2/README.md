## Amazon Sagemaker DevOps
Applying DevOps practices to Machine Learning (ML) workloads is a fundamental practice to ensure models are deployed using a reliable and consistent process as well as establishing a strategy for retraining your models.

DevOps is not about automating the deployment of a model. It is about applying practices such as Continuous Integration(CI) and Continuous Delivery(CD) to the development lifecycle. These practices rely on automation to achieve CI/CD but applying automation alone is not synonymous with CI/CD. In this lab, you will create a deployment pipeline utilizing AWS Development Services and SageMaker to demonstrate how CI/CD can be applied to machine learning workloads. There is no one-size-fits-all model for creating a pipeline; however, the same general concepts explored in this workshop can be applied across various services/tooling to meet the same end result.
